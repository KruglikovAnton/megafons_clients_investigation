Like any business, Megafon wants to increase the satisfaction of its customers with the quality of services. This is an important task for retaining users - both long-term and newly attracted. After all, the costs of marketing and promotion will not be justified if the client leaves due to poor communication quality. However, in the real world, resources are always limited, and in a unit of time, the technical department can solve a finite number of tasks.

In order to do this most effectively, it is important to determine which technical indicators of communication quality have the greatest impact on customer satisfaction, and first of all direct resources to work with them. To do this, MegaFon conducted a survey of its customers, inviting them to assess the level of satisfaction with the quality of communication. For each client who completed the survey, technical indicators were collected.


During the survey, Megafon offered its customers to rate their satisfaction with the quality of communication on a ten-point scale (where 10 is “excellent” and 1 is “terrible”). If the client rated the quality of communication at 9 or 10 points, the survey ended. If the client rated below 9, a second question was asked - about the reasons for dissatisfaction with the quality of communication with the provided numbered answer options. The answer could be given in a free format or list the answer numbers separated by commas. Below you can find an infographic on the structure of the survey.
